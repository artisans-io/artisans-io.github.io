Seven months ago, I embarked on a journey with the Artisans, stepping into a world where talent, collaboration, and professionalism thrive beyond borders. It’s been an exciting ride—one filled with challenges, learning experiences, and above all, incredible people who made every day fulfilling. From casual chit-chat and engaging discussions about technical aspects to a shared passion for remote work and traveling.

## Seven Months of Growth: A Farewell to an Incredible Team

From the start, I felt I had joined a place where everything was very well organized, and despite the large amount of information during onboarding, I quickly assimilated everything.

Working remotely comes with its own set of unique dynamics, but from the very first day, I felt part of something greater. Despite the distance, the culture here is one of true connection—where feedback is open, ideas flow freely, and support is never more than a message away. It's a place where no time is wasted. It’s rare to find a workplace where autonomy is balanced so well with teamwork, where every contribution is valued, and where leadership genuinely cares about growth—not just of the company, but of the individuals within it.

During my time here, I’ve had the opportunity to build, experiment, and refine my craft. I also received valuable feedback and support that helped me grow both as an individual and as a developer. I’ve worked on exciting projects, tackled complex problems, and evolved both technically and professionally. More than that, I’ve shared laughs, enjoyed virtual breakfast chats, and formed bonds with teammates that I know will last far beyond my time here.

But life is a series of chapters, and sometimes, a new adventure calls. For me, that call is coming from Silicon Valley—a place I’ve always dreamed of exploring, a challenge I feel ready to take on. Leaving this company isn’t easy; it’s not just a workplace, but a community. I’m deeply grateful for everything I’ve learned and for everyone I’ve had the privilege of working with.

To my colleagues, mentors, and friends here—thank you. Thank you for the support, the knowledge, and the inspiration. Though I’m moving on, I’ll carry everything I’ve gained here into this next chapter, and I have no doubt our paths will cross again in this ever-connected tech world.

<strong>Farewell,</strong><br />
