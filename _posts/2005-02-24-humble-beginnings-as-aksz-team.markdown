We started working together in 2005 when we first meet in high school. Amras and Settembrini founded artisans.io 12 years later:)

As AKSZ Team we create a presentation for Join Multimedia Challange organized by Siemens. For purpose of this project Michał Dziadkowiec created a custom 2min 3D intro. We even recorded a full CD Album!

Final presentation was interactive, user had the possibility to visit different sections by clicking on elements in the 3D Room.
