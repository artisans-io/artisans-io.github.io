      <h2>
        Collaboration is the most important factor
      </h2>
      Each of us is a great specialist in their field and most of the time we work independently, relying on mutual trust and the willingness to help others.
      <br/><br/>
      We say no to bureaucracy and nonsensical meetings, thanks to which we use our time efficiently. From the very beginning, we work 100% remotely, but we make up for it with regular live meetings in various Polish cities.
